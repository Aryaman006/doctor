          I wanted to serve people and help humanity. My thoughts were wandering between Politics or NGO's to choose to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was overweight and had tried different methods to slim down, shape up and become energetic. Had achieved about 10kgs with keto diets, oil-free diets, sweet free diets, brisk walks, aerobics, thigh and hips extra workouts. Had followed Rujutha Diwakar and read her book and a few more books. I tried everything but was unsuccessful to go further. Reached the awareness of the basic idea of good and bad diet methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day my Mother in law told me to accompany her to an Acutouch healer. When I visited her, she gave me the treatment and helped me understand the Healthy way of living. Many things made sense to me as I knew about diets. As I had thoughts of serving, I immediately enquired her about the procedures to learn Acutouch Therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started living according to the way of life, changed my way of eating, drinking, left all the medicines, took weekly treatments with Archana (Acutouch healer).
        </p>
        <p>
          I enrolled on the course and started my journey in the year 2016.

        <p>All my pains started leaving me one by one; Lethargy left me, Learning abilities started developing, my memory power increased. My wardrobe had to be changed completely.</p>
        <p>My husband liked my transformation. He got inspired to become thin and young.</p>
        <p>All my hard work started in learning Acutouch therapy. Drawings of anatomy, memorizing the points, Reading the books recommended had become my day's routine. I worked with my brother part-time to help him in his distribution business. Trying out different healthy recipes, taking care of household chores, studying Acutouch made my days complete. My husband, my parents, and my in-laws were proud of me for my chosen path.</p>
        <p>I started understanding why we get cold, cough, fever, vomit, lose motions, boils, psoriasis, etc., I started becoming free from diseases and disease phobia.</p>
        <p> was a Thyroid patient taking medications for more than ten years. I was always wondering to explore an opportunity to get rid of allopathy medicines but didnâ€™t find any until I reached my guru, Mr Magi Ramalingam.</p>
        <p>I stopped taking medications for all the so-called acute diseases and vaccinations for my son. Husband, parents, brother, mother in law started following the same. Now I know how the body does the healing, elimination of toxins and absorption of energy.</p>
        <p>If I had not gone to Archana the day my mother-in-law called me to visit her to understand about Acutouch, I would have been still with diseases and medications, lethargic, corona affected, and fearful. My son already had started with breathing difficulties. So would have been running around doctors to find a solution. My mother-in-law would have started with kidney dialysis. All the family members would have been depressed to see my mother in laws suffering and everyday visits to hospitals would be our routine. Lakhs of rupees would have gone for hospitals, medicines, and doctors, but health as well would have gone. I would not be sure if my mother-in-law would have been alive today.</p>
